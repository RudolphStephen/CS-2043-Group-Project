# Group 3 Submission 3 Workflow

**Author:** Christian Dennis

## Before You Start
- Ensure you already downloaded every student program as its own subfolder inside a single root directory.
- Have the path to that root directory ready (copy/paste works best).

## Step 1 – Choose the Student Submissions Folder
1. Launch the tool and either type or browse to the root folder containing all student subfolders.
2. Invalid or empty paths are rejected, so you must provide a valid location before continuing.

## Step 2 – Manage Test Cases and Test Suites
1. You land on the **Test Case / Suite Management** screen.
2. Pick the folder that contains (or will contain) your `test-cases/` and `test-suites/` directories.  
   - This path is used both for loading existing assets and saving anything new you create.
3. Create a suite or select an existing one:
   - When selecting, the tool scans the chosen folder for suite files and lists them.
   - When creating, click **Create New Suite**, give it a title, and it will be saved in the selected location.

### Working With Test Cases
- To build out a suite, either:
  - Add previously saved cases, or
  - Create brand-new ones (provide input, expected output, and type).
- New cases are saved under the `test-cases/` folder.
- Use **Add Test Case to Suite** to populate the active suite; the dropdown shows every case file found.
- Remove a case by selecting it in the suite list and clicking **Remove**.
- Need to edit/delete a case globally? Choose **Manage Test Cases**, pick the case, then **Modify** or **Delete**.  
  Changes here apply everywhere that case is used.

## Step 3 – Execute the Suite
1. When the suite looks good, press **Execute Test Suite**.
2. The app prompts for the path or nested folder structure that holds each student's code.  
   - Leave it blank if each submission's `Main`/entry point sits directly in the student's folder.
3. Start execution again from that screen to run all students through the selected suite.

## Step 4 – Review Results
- Results appear as rows using the format  
  `FolderName/StudentName | TestCaseName | Status`
  - Example: `Christian | Add Zero | FAIL`
- Highlight a row and click **View Comparison** to open a side-by-side view:
  - Left: expected output
  - Right: actual output
  - Works for every student/case combination.

## Step 5 – Save the Results (Optional)
- Use **Save As** to export the current results to a `.txt` file anywhere you like.
- The saved report groups entries by student, notes which suite was executed, and ends with a short summary.
